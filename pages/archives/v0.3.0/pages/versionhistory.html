				<h3>General Update</h3>
				<p>It's been a while since I last updated this website. It's been a huge transition from high school to college and I often find myself busy with other projects or enjoying 
					the city but I felt it was time to return to this vast project I adored so much. With newfound motivation, I spent hours this week learning more on PHP to finally get some 
					knowledge on backend functionality for the website and to put my newly acquired SQL knowledge to good use. I hope to keep this motivation going for further updates. 
					I'm excited to learn more and use my new skills in hopes of seeing this website on a live domain soon.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Website is now connected to a local PHP server and a SQL database</strong></li>
					<ul>
						<li>Database contains a list of all projects for better organization and ease of access. Currently there are three tables.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The projects table contains information on each project added to the website including name, category, access type, version, date created/updated, etc.</li>
							<li>The categories and access_types tables list all types of each respective table that are linked with the projects table through a foreign key. These will 
								be used for the filter feature on the products page to keep track of all types of projects without having to manually add them to the filter dropdown.</li>
							<li>More tables may be added to the future if needed. Some possible plans may be adding a table for each version on this page.</li>
							<li>I plan to added more columns to the projects table for more in-depth details such as descriptions, links, or images.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>PHP will allow for easy access to this database and backend functionality for the website</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Home Page index.html has been converted to index.php</li>
							<li>Featured sections on the Home Page will now contain projects directly from the database. SQL will select a featured project of my choice (from Project_ID), 
								the newest project, and the newly updated project. The last two are automatically updated when projects are created/updated in the database through an SQL query.</li>
							<li>As of now, this is all PHP manages. I have further plans to continue using PHP for other purposes, but my main goal was to get my local server 
								running and access the database.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Introducing a website archive feature here on the Version History page</strong></li>
					<ul>
						<li>From now on, for each update will include a snapshot of the website that can be previewed</li>
						<li>Note that you will not be able to open an archive while already viewing an archive to save on space and avoid confusion</li>
						<li>Also note that I will not be keeping archives of the database, so outdated versions that use the database may still display up-to-date project details</li>
						<li>The idea of these archive previews will be to see the website as it was at the given version to see how the website has changed over time</li>
						<li>Links to archive previews will be added to the bottom of each version description from now on</li>
						<li>Also added a couple other older versions of the website to the bottom of this version update</li>
						<li>The feature works great but some concerns I may have in the future is the file size of the website considering I'm essentially carrying multiple copies of the website. 
							Right now, the website is less than 500 KB so it shouldn't be a problem for a while but it's something to keep in mind for the future.</li>

				<h3>General Update</h3>
				<ul>
                    <li><strong>Further optimized coding format of the website using JavaScript</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Seperated main script into sections using comments for easy developer access</li>
                        <li>Added the <em>Constant Website Variables</em> section in the main script</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>rootDirec</em> - Defines the current root directory of the website files. When the website files are moved to a different directory,
                              simply change this variable to update all universal links and images that use the root directory.</li>
                            <li><em>version</em> - Defines the current version of the website. Simply change this varible to update the current version to the correct
                              number to display in elements such as the footer.</li>
                            <li><em>siteName</em> - Defines the current site name (Project Central as of now). Changing this variable will update all instances (except
                              the logo). This is in case I decide to change the name later.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Multiple elements such as the navigation bar, footer, and favicon are now coded in JavaScript to be more adaptive</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Now any updates to the nav bar, footer, or favicon can be displayed to all linked pages.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>The favicon image and links in the nav bar and footer are now pathed from the root of the folder. As of now, this means it starts
								  from the flash drive at <em>/media/removable/USB Drive/</em> on Chromebook. If the directory of the website changes, simply change the
								  <em>rootDIrec</em> varible and the website will be functional again.</li>
								<li>The nav bar is now adaptive to each page. If the page you are currently viewing is on the nav bar, it will be highlighted.</li>
								<li>The browser tab title is now adaptive to the website name. The <em>siteName</em> variable will be added to the end of an browser
								  tab title (the <em>&lt;title&gt;</em> tag in HTML).</li>
							</ul>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Version history is now also adaptive and the most recent version will open automatically on page load instead of having to manually assign the <em>recent</em> ID.</li>
                    </ul>
