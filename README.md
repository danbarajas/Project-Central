# Project Central

Project Central is currently my largest solo web project. This is still a work in progress and I hope to get an active domain for it soon.

Soon to be a full portfolio of all my projects, similar to GitHub. Also showcases many of my abilities in web design. Currently has multiple pages such as a home page, projects page, and a version history page. The Home page will show featured and new projects. The Projects page is a full lists of all projects and they're details. Soon each project will have its own page with a more in-depth description. The Version History page has an archive of all updates made to the Project Central website with some including an archived preview of what the website used to look like.

Initially started in high school in 2020, Project Central was created to serve as a hub for organizing all of my other projects and hobbies while also being a fun way for me to further explroe my interests in web design. Today, this project has grown to be much more, branching out from the basic HTML and CSS to include many different languages. Everything was started completely from scratch and it's been a blasting creating my own unique designs to fit my ideal website. I've put a lot of effort into this with almost all techniques and languages below being fully self-taught.
