# Project Central

Project Central is currently my largest solo web project. This is still a work in progress, and I hope to get an active domain for it soon.

Soon to be a full collection of all my projects and hobbies, in and out of computer science. Also showcases many of my abilities in web design. Currently has multiple pages such as a home page, projects page, and a version history page. The Home page will show featured, new, and random projects. The Projects page is a full list of all projects and their details. Soon, each project will have its own page with a more in-depth description. The Version History page has an archive of all updates made to the Project Central website with some including an archived preview of what the website used to look like. 

The Home page will have both manually set projects in the Featured section as well as automatically set projects in the New section based on when they were published on the site and in a carousel where projects will be randomly chosen on each page load. The Projects page will pull all details from an SQL database, displaying them in a table/list layout. The details can be searched, filtered, and sorted using the controls at the top. Each action will be processed with PHP and SQL and updated to the page without reloading using AJAX. The Version History page is a manual archive of the site where I will post the changes made to the website in-depth and an archival version of the updated site for future reference.

Initially started in high school in 2020, Project Central was created to serve as a hub for organizing all of my other projects and hobbies while also being a fun way for me to further explore my interests in web design. Today, this project has grown to be much more, branching out from the basic HTML and CSS to include many different languages. Everything was created completely from scratch, and I've truly enjoyed putting my creativity to the test by making my own unique designs to fit my ideal website. I've put much effort into this, with almost all techniques and languages below being fully self-taught.
